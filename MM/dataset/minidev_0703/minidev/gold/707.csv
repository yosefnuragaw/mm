"Welcome to Cross Validated David P, for more information about the site and how to ask questions, you can check out the [FAQ](http://stats.stackexchange.com/faq). Is your question just about whether the calculation is right or wrong (it is wrong, with the numbers you give on your second line the result of the operation is 0.187, rounded)? Otherwise, yes, a percentage can be as close to zero as you can imagine because it is bounded between 0 and 100 and continuous on that interval."
