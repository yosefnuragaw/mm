"Reminds me that in my early days as a referee i spent *far* too long reviewing a statistical paper that was eventually rejected by that particular journal, but the other referees and I suggested a more useful application for the method, and I also sketched an algebraic proof to replace an unsatisfactory simulation study in the manuscript. The authors have since got two published papers out of it. I'm not *annoyed* by that, but an acknowledgement such as ""we thank referees of an earlier version of the paper for helpful comments"" would have been good manners."
"If you're going to use R, I'd recommend embedding your R code in an Sweave document that produces your report.  That way the R code stays with the report."
"As a non-expert, I think that the key to the entire debate is that people actually reason like Bayesians. You have to be trained to think like a frequentist, and even then it's easy to slip up and either reason or present your reasoning as if it were Bayesian. ""There's a 95% chance that the value is within this confidence interval."" Enough said."
"In the linear regression model the dependent variable $y$ is considered continuous, whereas in logistic regression it is categorical, i.e., discrete. In application, the former is used in regression settings while the latter is used for binary classification or multi-class classification (where it is called multinomial logistic regression)."
Did anyone else notice that the tour guide changes colors between the second and third frames?
